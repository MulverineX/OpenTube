About
</h2>

This project is meant to reattach to the official YouTube APIs, to provide a stable, responsive, and fully featured experience. While some people are concerned with Google's tracking, others prefer better algorithmic results when the site has something to work with.

If you care about the minuscule differences in online safety reduced data collection on YouTube can bring, check out the project this is based on.
<details>
  <summary>LibreTube Privacy Schpiel</summary>
  YouTube has an extremely invasive [privacy policy](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/10364219) which relies on using user data in unethical ways. They store a lot of your personal data - ranging from ideas, music taste, content, political opinions, and much more than you think.

  This project is aimed at improving the users' privacy by being independent from Google and bypassing their data collection.
  
  Therefore, the app is using the [Piped API](https://github.com/TeamPiped/Piped), which uses proxies to circumvent Google's data collection and includes some other additional features.
</details>

If you have questions or need help, please make sure to read the [FAQ](https://open-tube.github.io/#faq) before asking for help at the community channels. The [Discord server](https://youtube.com/watch?v=QdezFxHfatw) is considered as the main communication channel, all other forums or social media accounts are maintained by volunteers from the community but not the developer(s).

Differences to LibreTube & NewPipe
</h2>


With NewPipe, the extraction is done locally on your phone, and all the requests sent towards YouTube/Google are done directly from the network you're connected to, which doesn't use a middleman server in between. Therefore, Google can still access information such as the user's IP address. Aside from that, subscriptions can only be stored locally.

With LibreTube takes this one step further and proxies all requests via Piped (which uses the NewPipeExtractor). This prevents Google servers from accessing your IP address or any other personal data.<br>
Apart from that, Piped allows syncing your subscriptions between LibreTube and Piped, which can be used on desktop too.

OpenTube recognizes the great UI work done by the LibreTube team, but has decided to improve user experience by reversing these privacy changes in favor of responsiveness & stability.
All requests will be made directly using your YouTube account via https://github.com/LuanRT/YouTube.js using https://github.com/HarlonWang/quickjs-wrapper, with support for synced subscriptions & keeping your recommendations good.
We will also be pursuing feature parity with the official YouTube app, to provide an up-to-par experience.

While OpenTube only supports YouTube, NewPipe also allows the use of other platforms like SoundCloud, PeerTube, Bandcamp and media.ccc.de.<br>
All are great clients for watching YouTube videos. It depends on the individual's use case which one fits their needs better.
